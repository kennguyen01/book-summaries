> The best way to identify and fix your weaknesses is to find a good teacher. Without a teacher, you need to fully engage with your practice and constantly push beyond your comfort zone. Design your practice so that you can work on your weaknesses. Avoid mindless repetitions by challenging yourself in new ways whenever you hit a plateau. Believe that you can improve and surround yourself with people who have similar goals for improvements.

## Find a Good Teacher

Most people try to learn something either online or through books, given the expenses of private instructions. But you will not be able to figure out the *best ways to fix your weaknesses* even if you identify them. It is difficult because your mental representations are still inaccurate so you need an experienced teacher to provide feedback.

Even the most motivated and intelligent student will advance more quickly under the tutelage of a good teacher. The teacher will only be able to guide you to the level that they have attainted. Once you're more skilled, you want to get a more advanced teacher.

### Engagement

It is important to engage in purposeful practice instead of mindless repetition without any clear plan for getting better. If you want to improve in chess, you want to do solitary study of the grandmasters' games.

A study of professional and amateur singers in Sweden showed that *only the amateurs feel happy after lessons*. The lessons gave the amateur singers a time to express themselves and experience the joy of singing. For the professionals, they used the lessons to concentrate on things like vocal technique and breath control to improve their singing. There was **focus but no joy**.

Consciously developing and refining your skills are the most powerful ways to improve the effectiveness of your practice. The key to excellence is performing correctly over and over until *execellence becomes an ingrained habit*.

Maintaining this sort of focus is hard work. People who are just learning to focus won't be able to maintian it for several hours. Focus needs to be gradually developed.

### Without a Teacher

**Benjamin Franklin** came up with a series of clever techniques aimed at teaching himself how to write well:

- He tried to reproduce good articles from hints and correct them against the original articles. This taught him to express ideas clearly and cogently.
- He took articles and transformed them into poem verses. After a while, he transform the poems back into prose. This increased the number of words he can recall.
- He jumbled the hints on articles and arranged them in his most logical order. This forced him to think carefully about how to order the structure and logic of writing.

The hallmark of deliberate practice is taking you out of your comfort zone. Daily life rarely provides these opportunities for focused repetition. There are many methods available online but have little quality control. You want to try them out and see what works best for you.

The *purpose of repetition is figuring out weaknesses* and focus on getting better in those areas. Comedians spend time in comedy clubs to try out their materials and delivery. They get immediate feedback from the audience to polish their routines. 

The **3 F's of practicing** without a teacher:

1. Focus
2. Feedback
3. Fix

Break the skill down into components that you can do repeatedly and analyze effectively, determine your weaknesses, and figure out ways to address them.

Mozart's father taught him to compose in part by having him copy and study the best composers. Aspiring *artists developed skills by copying* paintings and scultures of the masters. Successful mental representations are tied to actions, not just thoughts, and they require extended practice.

## Plateaus

When you first start learning something new, it is normal to see rapid and steady improvement. When that improvement stops, it is natural to believe you hit some sort of limit. So *you stop trying to move past that plateau* and settle down at that level. This is the major reason that people stop improving.

The best way to move beyond it is to **challenge yourself in a new way**. Any complex skill involve a variety of components, you need to figure out which one is holding you back. If you're a manager, pay attention to what goes wrong when things get busy. Those problems are indications of weaknesses that were always there but usually less obvious.

See *what breaks down first* when you push yourself outside your comfort zone. Then design a practice technique aimed at improve that particular weakness. Pay attention to what happens when you practice. You want to target those specific problem areas rather than trying random things and hoping that something works. 

## Motivation

Purposeful practice is hard work. It's hard to keep going and it's hard to maintain focus while you are doing it.

We all have various motivations at various times and in various situations. People who are overweight generally can start a diet program and lose some weight. But eventually they see their progress stop and gradually regain the weight. The ones who are successful in the long run are *those who redesigned their lives*. This means building new habits to maintain the behaviors despite temptations and setbacks. 

Maintaining motivation has 2 parts: reasons to keep going and reasons to stop. When the reasons to stop outweigh the reasons to continue, you quit. To improve, you can either strengthen reasons to keep going or weaken reasons to quit.

### Planning and Belief

Most violin students prefer to practice as soon as they get up in the morning. They set aside the time for practice. This creates a sense of habit and duty to make it less like to be distracted. Good *planning can help you avoid temptations*. 

Look for anything that might interfere with your training and minimize its influence. **Small factors add up** to make training less effective.

As you maintain your practice over time it will become easier. You will become habituate to the practice. The practice doesn't become fun, but it eventually gets closer to neutral. 

Once you can see the results, *the skill becomes part of your motivation*. You start to identify yourself with this new identity from the many hours of practice. It becomes and investment rather than an expense. 

A key motivational factor is **the belief that you can succeed**. To push yourself, you must believe that you can improve and to rank among the best. A study found that when future experts were young, their parents would use various strategies to keep them from quitting. If you stop believing that you can reach a goal, make an agreement with yourself to at least *get beyond the plateau before you quit*.

At its core, *deliberate practice is a lonely pursuit*. Much of your improvement will depend on your own practice. Break your journey into manageable series of goals and focus on them one at a time so you are constantly seeing concrete signs of improvements. 

### Social Environment

One of the best ways to create and sustain motivation is to *surround yourself with people who encourage, support, and challenge you* in your endeavors. One thing to be careful about is to make sure that other members have similar goals for improvement. Violin students spend their time with people who appreciate their passion and understand their need to prioritize practice.

Ben Franklin recruited 11 people to form a mutual improvement club called **the Junto**. The members met every week and encourage each other's various intellectual pursuits. This gave Franklin additional motivation to delve into different topics to engage with other members.
