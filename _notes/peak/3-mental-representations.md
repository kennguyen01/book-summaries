> Mental representations are the building blocks of expert performance. Deliberate practice is the process of developing more sophisticated mental representations that can recognize and respond to patterns without conscious thoughts. The more skilled you become, the better your mental representations are, and the more effectively you can practice to hone your skill.

## Blindfold Chess

In 1924, the Russian grandmaster **Alexander Alekhine** played 26 of the best chess players without being able to see the boards. When an opponent made a move, a runner called out the board number and the move so that Alekhine could hear it. It took more than 12 hours and Alekhine won 16, lost 5, and played to a draw in 5 more.

Alekhine started playing chess when he was 7. He became interested in blindfold chess after seeing an exhibition in Moscow where Harry Nelson Pillsbury played 22 games simultaneously. Over time, he practiced to the point where he could play whole games in his mind without needing to look at the board. Eventually he set the world record at *32 games* in 1933.

Many grandmasters are able to play blindfold chess. This connection is a clue regarding their ability to analyze chess positions and find the best moves. Similar mental processes are seen in expert performers in every field.

### Secrets to Winning Chess

Given just a few seconds to study a chessboard, grandmasters will remember the correct positions for most pieces. They are able to reproduce the important areas of the board almost perfectly. This ability defied the known limits of short-term memory.

**Herb Simon and Bill Chase** carried out an experiment to test whether chess experts remembered each piece or the general patterns of the board. A chess master, a mid-range player, and a novice were recruited. When they were shown the boards from real games, the master and the mid-range player were able to remember the board much better than the novice. But the experienced players did not do much better than the novice when the *pieces are placed randomly*.

A similar effect can be shown with verbal memory. If a person is given a random list of words, only the first 6 words are remembered. But if the words are arranged into a sentence that makes sense, most people remember most of the sentence. The meaning of the words allow people to form a mental representation to help them better remember.

The ability to recognize chess patterns is a result of studying games played by the masters. Research has shown that the amount of time spent analyzing games is the most important predictor of a chess player's ability. These patterns called **chunks** are held in long-term memory. These chunks allow a chess master to analyze the general patterns from a higher level. 

## Mental Representations

A **mental representation** is a mental structure that corresponds to an object, a collection of information, or any concrete or abstract idea. As you learn more information about an idea, everthing becomes integrated into one holistic concept instead of individual pieces.

A key fact about mental representations is that they are *domain specific*. They only apply to the skill they were developed for. There is no such thing as developing a general skill. You don't train to become an athlete; you train to become a gymnast, swimmer, or sprinter. Some people do become overall experts with a general set of skills, but they did it by training in different areas.

Mental representations make it possible to process large amounts of information quickly, despite the limits of short-term memory. Through years of practice, expert performers developed *sophisticated representations* to make them more effective in their fields. This is what separates the novice and the experts. 

### Recognizing Patterns

An expert has the ability to *see hidden patterns* in things that would seem random to normal people. To learn what the experts are able to see, a study investigated how well soccer players can predict what's going to happen in a game. Accomplished players were much better at deciding what the player with the ball should do. The advantage better players have is their ability to *envision outcomes and choose the best response*.

Similar study was done with football players. The most successful quarterbacks generally spend the most time watching and analyzing plays. Their mental representations allow them to keep track of what's happening everywhere on the field.

#### Analyzing Information

An ability that the majority of adults learned early is **reading**. Reading require breaking up strings of words into meaningful chunks. There are various patterns to allow the readers to infer the words they have never seen before. But there are people who are better at understanding and assimilating the information contained in a book.

To see how people retain information. A group of people were tested on how much they remember from a newspaper article on a specialized topic, such as football or baseball. The study showed that *people who understood the topic had better comprehension*. If the reader didn't know much about the topic, the details were unrelated facts with no meaning. For a reader who already had a mental representation, the new information was integrated into their long-term memory.

#### Finding Answers

When doctors make diagnoses, they are given a lot of information abou the patients' conditions. The doctors must be able to assimilate those facts, recall relevant knowledge, and select the best options for the patients. 

Medical students tend to associate symptoms with the conditions they're familar with and jump quickly to conclusions. Due to their inexperiences, they *fail to generate multiple options*. Experienced doctors see symptoms and other relevant data as *pieces of a larger patterns*. The organized and accessible knowledge allow the doctors to zero in on the most likely causes of the issues.

### Planning

Better mental representations create more effective planning. For writing, a novice writer tend to write down all their ideas until they cannot think up of anything else to write. A better writer include a structure to the writing. This approach to writing is called **knowledge telling** because it simply tells the reader whatever comes to your mind. 

With expert writers, they ask themselves what they want to convey and break down each chapter with only the necessary information. They understand why each piece was there and what they wanted to accomplish with it. In the process of writing, they would come up with new ways to think about the topic and adds to the knowledge. This writing is called **knowledge transforming** because it uses feedback to modify the writing as necessary. 

### Learning

When practicing a new piece of music, beginning musicians generally lack a good, clear idea of how the music should sound. The advanced musicians already have a detailed idea of how they want to play the piece. They *use their mental representations to guide their practice* and identify subtle mistakes. Great musicians understand various qualities of their playing such as pitch, length, intonation, and harmonic relationship with other notes.

The more accomplish musicians are also better able to determine difficult sections that they need to focus on. They can match appropriate practice techniques with the types of difficulties they have with the music. *Better mental representations lead to more effective practice*.

The psychologist **Roger Chaffin** worked together with **Gabriela Imreh**, a world class pianist, to learn how an expert uses mental represenations. The first thing Imreh did when she read a new piece was to develop an **artistic image** of the music. By putting differnet elements into an overall map of the piece, she gave herself a clear idea of what she needed to pay close attention to as she was playing.
