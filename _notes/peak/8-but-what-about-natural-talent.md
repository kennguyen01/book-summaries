> People like to believe that talent plays a major role in becoming the best. But many stories about prodigies are greatly embellished. With enough digging into the background of those stories, the main driver was practice. There is no correlation between innate characteristics, such as intelligence, and future development in the long term. Believing in talent can be harmful because many children are discouraged from trying something if they do not succeed at first. 

## Natural Talent

One of the most enduring beliefs is that natural talent plays a major role in determining ability. People assumed that talented people need far less practice and can reach much greater heights.

### Paganini

Paganini was the greatest violinist of his era. One of his story described how he was able to finish his piece even as his violin strings snapped one by one. The audience believed that he was able to do it because he was a genius.

The real story, told by Paganini, was a different matter. He planned for the strings to snap during the performance. He wrote the piece so that it could be played with fewer and fewer strings. It was *the product of long, careful practice*.

### Donald Thomas

Donald Thomas was an undergraduate who seemed to be able to jump extremely high despite having no training. The story about him dramatized how he was able to achieve that because he was born with the right genes.

After digging into his background, there was more to the story. Thomas told an interviewer that he competed in the high jump back in high school. There were photos of Thomas using the **Fosbury Flop**, a high jump technique that required extended practice. Thomas was also a basketball player who spent a lot of time to train his dunking ability. All of the evidence showed that Thomas trained to be able to jump high, not just because he was born with those genes. 

### Mozart

Mozart was considered to be the **prime example of a prodigy**. He went on tours across Europe from the time he was 6 years old. People back then had never seen anything like him. Today, we are accustomed to seeing 5 and 6 years old playing beautifully on the violin and piano. We know that these young children went through intense practice to develop their abilities. 

Even Mozart's early compositions were *based on sonatas written by others*. When he began to compose original and sophisticated music, he had been composing for a decade or so. 

### Savants

People with **savant syndrome** are said to have extraordinary abilities despite suffering from mental disabilities. But autistic savants are different from other autistic children. They are *detail-oriented and prone to repetitive behaviors*. When something captures their attention, they focus on it to the exclusion of everything else. 

They are more likely to practice obsessively and develop skills in the same way people engaging in deliberate practice do. In the 1960s, the psychologist **Barnett Addis** learned how savants were able to calculate calendar days. He taught the method to a normal graduate student and hte student was able to calculate just as fast as the savants. 

## Anti-Prodigies

Every time you look closely into cases of extraordinary abilities, the foundation is always practice. But on the flip side, there are people who seem to have no talent at all in certain fields. 

About *1/6 of Americans believe they can't sing*. Somewhere along the way someone convinced them that they were tone-deaf and couldn't sing. It's usually some sort of authority figure such as parent or teacher. But the actual medical condition is exceedingly rare. The major obstacle for these people is the belief itself. 

The same negative belief is also prevalent in math. A large percentage of students believe they do not have the capacity to learn complicated math. But multiple studies has shown that any child can learn math if it's taught the right way. The problem is with how math classes are designed.

### Chess and Go

People generally assumed chess skill is tied with brilliant minds. Chess mastery signals intelligence. Multiple studies were conducted to find out the relationships between IQ and chess skill. Surprisingly, they found that *even grandmasters do not have higher IQs than other adults* with similar levels of education. Similar results were found with Go. Studies of Korean Go experts found that they score no higher on IQ tests than the general population. 

Another study followed 57 children from different clubs as they progressed in chess. The results showed that in the best group, *players with lower IQs were slightly better than those with higher IQs*. They practiced more in an effort to keep up and in the long run, they actually became better. 

### Role of Genetic

While people with innate characteristics may have an advantage when first learning a skill, that advantage gets smaller over time. The *amount and quality of practice determine the skill level* over time. Among professional musicians, tests have found that IQ and music performance have no correlation. 

The average IQ of scientists is higher than the general population. But there is also no correlation between their IQs and scientific productivity. Outside of basic physical traits in sports, there is no solid evidence that a minimum intelligence requirement exists in any field.

Genetic differences, if they exist, are most likely to manifest through the necessary practice and efforts that go into developing a skill. 

When people assume that talent plays a major role, it becomes the **self-fulfilling prophecy**. The children who don't excel in something right away are encouraged to try something else. While the gifted ones are given more resources and attention to succeed.
