> The traditional approach to learning new skill is about acquiring knowledge. This approach is limited because performance does not necessarily improve by having more knowledge. The assumption that more experience leads to better performance places the burden on performers to improve without seeking help. Having skill-based training programs allow people to practice their skill over and over again without the high risk of failure on the job.

## Top Gun School

During the Vietnam war, the U.S. pilots were not doing well against the North Vietnamese. The navy was losing one jet for every jet they shot down. The navy decided to establish **Navy Fighter Weapons School** to improve their pilots.

The best pilots were picked to become the trainers. They engaged in training combat with the next best pilots, equipped with cameras to record the encounters. Afterward, *the trainers provided students with feedback* on how to do it better next time. The training session had many elements of deliberate practice. The results in the actual dogfights showed that each time navy pilots contact the enemy, they would shot down an enemy plane.

Experience in other wars had shown that pilots who won their first dogfight were much more likely to survive subsequent dogfights. The problem was that the cost of on-the-job training was too high. Failures meant death or prison camp. The Top Gun school provided pilots with the opportunities to *try different things without fatal consequences*. This worked because the training pushed the students almost as hard as real combat.

## Practicing and Working

There are no shortage of consultants who offer advice on how to improve in the professional world. Of all the different approaches, the ones most likely to succeed resemble deliberate practice. To improve requires recognizing and rejecting three prevailing myths:

1. One's abilities are limited by one's genetically prescribed characteristics.
2. If you do something long enough, you're bound to get better at it.
3. All it takes to improve is effort.

Anyone can improve in any area they focus on. The caveat is that it requires the right approach. **Art Turock** was a consultant who worked with companies to improve the employees. He incorporates the idea of *learning while real work gets done* into the employees' regular schedule.

Each employee can choose to focus on one area they want to improve on. Other employees can evaluate the performance and provide feedbacks. This gets people into the habit of practicing and thinking about practice. Eventually, practice becomes part of the normal business day.

### The Top Gun Approach

In the early days of Top Gun project, no one tried to figure what made the best pilots great. They just set up *a program that mimicked the real situations* in dogfights and allowed pilots to practice without costs of failure. This is a good recipe for training programs in differentt disciplines.

Radiologists regularly review X-rays to **detect breast cancers**. They often are not notified about the results and cannot reexamine what they might have missed. For better training, a library was created of digitized mammograms so the *radiologists can practice their readings over and over again*. The library was used to train residents and the feedbacks helped the residents improve their diagnostic dramatically.

This is the rationale behind *using simulators to train* pilots, surgeons, and other high-stakes professions.

### Knowledge Versus Skills

Traditionally, the path to expertise focuses on knowledge. Deliberate practice, by contast, focuses solely on performance and how to improve it. The **preference for knowledge** is that it's much easier to present knowledge than set up conditions where individuals can develop skills through practice.

Doctors don't begin specializing and develop necessary skills until they graduate from medical schools. After internships and residencies, doctors are assumed to have all the skills they need to work as full-fledged physicians. Research has shown that doctors *cannot gain expertise from experience alone*.

The field of medicine lacks a strong tradition of supporting the training futher improvement of professionals. The burden is placed on doctors to figure out on their own the most effective methods to practice and improve. The *argument is that skills can be mastered if the knowledge is there*.

This is the general pattern in traditional education. The result is that once the students enter the work force, they need a lot of time to develop the skills they need to do their jobs. 

### New Approach to Training

The best approach to training is to *develop skill-based trainings* that will supplement or replace knowledge-based trainings. The principles of deliberate practice can be applied to develop more effective training methods for doctors.

The first step is to determine who the expert doctors are in a given area. For surgeries, an objective measure can be the success rate in preventing recurrence of cancer after operation. This is because the patients are monitored after operation and this gave surgeons feedback on how well they performed and what went wrong.

The next step is to figure out what underlies their superior performance. Doctors can write reports to describing their thinking process as they perform a task. This can provide clues on characteristics of mental representations of the best doctors. This sort of adaptive thinking give insights on how great doctors evaluate alternative options if the operations did not go as planned.
