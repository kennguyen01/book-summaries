> Deliberate practice arises from highly developed fields. In these fields there are objective criteria of performance, competitions that drive improvement, and training techniques that have been developed over time. Students in these fields have the opportunities to learn from expert performers and can work with good teachers to improve specific aspects of their performance.

> The traits of deliberate practice are:
> - Effective training techniques designed by good teachers.
> - Pushes past the comfort zone.
> - Has well-defined goals to target specific improvements.
> - Is self-directed by the student to monitor their own progress.
> - Building on top of correct fundamental skills.

## A Developed Field

Activities such as classical music, math, and ballet are highly developed fields. If the students follow the methods diligently, they will almost surely become an expert.

These fields have **objective performance measurement**. They are competitive enough that *performers have strong incentive to improve*. Relevant skills have already been developed over decades or centuries.

There are teachers and coaches that have built sophisticated training techniques to increase the performers' skill level. Techniques that do not work are discarded.

### The Violin Challenge

Violinists spend countless hours practicing before they are able to play well. The primary difference between students lies in the amount of time they devoted to solitary practice.

In an experiment to find out how motivation affects practice, three groups of violinists were chosen from the Berlin University of the Arts: good, better, and best. A key finding was that all students agreed *improvement was hard and they did not enjoy practicing*. They were motivated to practice because they saw it as essential to improve performance.

By the time the students were 18, the best group practiced an average 7,410 hours, the better group 5,301 hours, and the good group 3,420 hours. The differences in practice time came from their preteen and teenage years. To become an excellent violinist requires several thousand hours of pratice. There are no shortcuts and **no prodigies with little practice**. The students who spent more time practice were more accomplished than their peers. 

Similar results were found in other fields such as dance, sports, and science. Nobody develops extraordinary abilities without putting in tremendous amount of practice.

## Deliberate Practice

The levels of performance in developed fields have increased greatly over time. The improvement in performance goes together with better teaching methods. The teachers assigning practice activities to push the students to move beyond their current skill levels. *Competition is vital* because it provides an objective criteria for what superior performance looks like.

Purposeful practice is when people try very hard to push themselves to improve. **Deliberate practice** is the combination purposeful practice that knows where it is going and how to get there.

### Traits of Deliberate Practice

Deliberate practice is characterized by the following traits:

- Effective training techniques overseen by a teacher or coach.
- Demands full concentration and not enjoyable.
- Involves practice on targeted aspects of perfomance.
- Requires feedback and modifications to correct mistakes.
- Builds on existing skills to construct better mental representations.

### Applying the Principles

When Steve Faloon was memorizing digits, he was not using deliberate practice to improve. There was no known training methods and no teachers offering lessons. He had to figure it out by trial and error.

In 2011, **Feng Wang** set the world record by recalling 300 digits. His method is as followed:

- Takes each set of 4 numbers from the string of digits.
- Encodes it as a pair of images corresponding to each 2 digits.
- Places the images inside a mental map of physical locations.
- Recalls numbers by travelling along his map and translate the images back to numbers.

This was a modern version of the **memory palace** method that people have used since Greece. His method was similar to Steve's but much more sophisticated and effective.

In a new field, the principles of deliberate practice should still be applied as much as possible. You should identify the expert performers, figure out what they do that made them great, and come up with training techniques to emulate the process. The process will not be easy so it's best to work with a techer with experience in the field. 

### 10,000 Hours Fallacy

In the book *Outliers*, Malcolm Gladwell wrote a catchy phrase: "the ten-thousand-hour rule." He suggested that it takes about 10,000 hours of practice to become a master in most fields. This rule is popular because it offers a simple path to mastery of any skill.

This rule is wrong in several ways. The *required time varies from field to field*. Pianists who win international competitions already put more than 25,000 hours of practice by then. People who memorize digits practice much less than 10,000 hours.

The *quality of practice is important*. Regular practice is not the same as goal-driven practice designed to address specific weaknesses. Not every type of practice leads to improvement.

By using 10,000 hours, the emphasis is on the daunting nature of the task. Instead, the core message should be that *people have tremendous capacity to improve their performance by practicing the right way*. There is no point at which performance maxes out and additional proper practice does not lead to further improvement.
