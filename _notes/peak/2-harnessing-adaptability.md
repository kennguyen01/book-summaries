> The brain has the ability to rewires itself to become better at different skills. The process only happens when the brain is being pushed past homeostasis and has to overcompensate. Regular training leads to changes in the parts of the brain that are challenged by the training. To keep improving, the challenges need to also become more and more difficult. Maintenance of the skill requires upkeep and prolonged training can also cause a decline in another skill.

## Brain Data

There is no easy way to observe the changes in the brain as it develops complex skills. Neuroscientists have begun to study what types of training produce particular changes using technology such as MRI. With the body, research data came from studies of runners, weightlifters, and other athletes. For the brain, the best data came from studies of London **taxi drivers**.

### London Cabbies

The streets of London are so complex that they give GPS systems a difficult time. Visitors are better off hiring the cabbies instead of renting a car. To become a licensed taxi driver in London, the driver must memorize 25,000 streets, all landmarks, and any point of interest within the area. It is one of the most difficult test in the world.

In an in-depth study of the cabbies by a neuroscientist **Eleanor Maguire**, she found that the **posterior hippocampus**, the brain area engaged in spatial navigation and remembering locations, of the taxi drivers were significantly larger than those of the bus drivers. The study also followed prospective drivers before and after they become licensed. The years spent training and acquring knowledge of London streets actually enlarged that area of the brain.

## Adaptability

In the past, the general belief was that the wiring of the brain is fixed in adulthood. Individual differences were due to genetic potential. From Maguire's work, people learned that the brain has incredible adaptability.

Earliest observations appeared in the studies of **blind people**. Their brains rewire the neurons for area that are normally dedicated to processing sights or sounds. When blind people read words in Braille, the visual cortex would activate to help them interpret input from their fingers.

In 2012, a study recrruited middle-aged volunteers with **farsightedness**. They were asked to spot an image against a background with very little contrast between them. The process required intense concentration and effort. After three months of training, they were able to read letters at least 60% smaller than they could at the beginning. There were no changes in the eyes for these subjects. The impprovement was due to the changes in how the brain interprets visual signals from the eyes. The brain learned to increase the image clarity by manipulating the contrast.

### Homeostasis

The human body has a *preference for stability*. When the body is being pushed beyond the point that homeostatic mechanisms can compensate, it activate different genes in response. Cells go through biochemical changes to get back to homeostasis.

By pushing the body long and hard enough, it will respond by changing the body to meet the challenge. The person will get stronger and faster. To keep the changes happening, the body needs to be pushed beyond its current limit over and over again. But pushing too far and the injuries can set back all of the changes.

The difference with the brain is that brain cells generally do not divide and form new cells. The brain rewires the networks by strengthening or weakening various connections between neurons. There can also be an increase in **myelin sheath** to allow signals to travel more quickly. Learning a new skill is more effective at triggering structural changes than continuing to practice a learned skill.

### Shaping the Brain

In 1995, the psychologist **Edward Taub** studied how musical training affects the brain. He recruited 6 musicians and 6 nonmusicians to see if there was any difference in the brains between the two groups. The study found that the brain region controlling the left hand was significantly larger in musicians. That region had taken over a section of the region normally devoted to the palm. The musicians were violinists, cellists, and guitarist, who use their left fingers with extreme accuracy and speed.

Years of **musical practice** on sringed instrument caused the area of the brain that controls the left hand to gradually expand, resulting in greater ability to control those fingers.

Similar results were found with mathematicians. The longer they worked in math, the more gray matter was found in their brains. The increased size was a product of extended mathematical thinking, not something a person was born with.

The pattern is consistent. Regular training leads to changes in the parts of the brain that are challenged by the training. The brain *adapts to challenges* by rewiring itself in ways that increase its ability to carry out the functions required. 

#### Training Effects

Younger brains are more adaptable than adult brains are, so training can have a larger effects in younger people. Training at an **early age** can shape the course of later development, leading to certain neurological advantages that adults can't match with.

Prolonged training can come at a cost. Developing one skill to an extraordinary degree can cause a *decline in other abilities*. Increasing more capacity for one part of the brain leave less for other parts.

Cognitive and physical changes *require upkeep*. They go away when training is stopped. Astronauts who spend months in space without gravity find it difficult to walk on Earth. Retired London cabbies have less gray matter in their posterior hippocampi than active drivers.

### Building Potential

Most people do not have physically demanding lives. Skills can be developed but they require far more practice than most people are willing to devote. This is the world of good enough.

It's important to remember that *the option exists* to become extraordinary at something. The goal requires challenging homeostasis and forcing the brain to adapt. Learning becomes a way of taking control how potential develops.
