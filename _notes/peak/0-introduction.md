> Some people are great at what they do. Even though it seems like they are born with innate talent, research has shown that dedicated training helped the brain develop faster. The same gift everyone has is the adaptability of the brain and body. Deliberate practice takes advantage of this gift for continuous improvement.

## Perfect Pitch

Mozart had the **pefect pitch ability** to identify the exact note for a sound.

- Only 1 in 10,000 people has it.
- Among great musicians, it is still a rare ability.
- It is thought to be a innate talent that only prodigies were born with.

With modern data, there are two common traits people with perfect pitch have:

1. They received musical training in their childhood.
2. People who speak tonal language, such as Madarin or Vietnamese, are more likely to have perfect pitch.

In 2014, an **experiment** was conducted in Japan to see if the ability can be learned. 24 children between 2 and 6 years old were taught music over a long period. At the end of the training, every child acquired perfect pitch and could identify the notes played on the piano. The study showed that anyone can develop perfect pitch with proper training.

Investigation into Mozart's life revealed that his father, Leopold Mozart, taught him and his sister music from a young age. Without the extensive training, he might not have developed the ability at all. 

### Neuroplasticity

Scientists used to believe that the brain had a *fixed capacity*. No amount of practice would help if you didn't have the right genes. Each person is born with limited potential with no additional room for improvement. The purpose of training was simply to allow the person to reach his potential and no more.

Today, research showed that even adult brain is very *adaptable*. Even though children learn faster than adult, neural connections can be strengthened and new neurons can grow well into adulthood. Learning is a way of expanding the reservoir of potential. However, hard work alone is not sufficient. The right training method must be implemented. 

**Deliberate practice** is a general set of principles for developing expertise. It is the process of improving the mental processes. Training becomes more effective when we can learn how the experts improves themselves.
