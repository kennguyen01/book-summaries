> Most people learn a new skill until they are good enough to perform it automatically. They do not improve anymore despite using the skill repetitively over time. To get past the plateau, the practice needs to be purposeful. Purposeful practice must have specific goals, be focused, involves feedback, and push beyond the comfort zone. Managing motivation is essential because this process is difficult and not enjoyable.

## Memorizing Digits

In the 1970s, **Steve Faloon** was an undergraduate who participated in an experiment to memorize numbers. Steve was selected for the experiment because he was an average student at the university. After the first week, Steve was ready to give up because he could not get past 8 digits.

- Before this experiment, decades of research indicated that the brain has a strict limit for short-term memory. It is about 7 items.
- No one has found the upper limits of long-term memory but it takes much longer to recall.

During the experiment, the professor reads 1 digit per second so Steve has to rely on his short-term memory. The process for the session is as followed:

1. Start with 5 digits
2. Right answer increases the string by 1 digit
3. Wrong answer decreases the string by 2 digits

After several training sessions, Steve was suddenly able push past the ceiling and got 11 digits correctly. From that point, Steve was able to improve steadily. After about 100 sessions, he got 40 digits right. By the end of more than 200 sessions, he could recall more than *82 digits*. Steve was not aware that the task was deemed impossible until afterwards.

## Extraordinary Performers

In 1908, the marathon world record was 2 hours, 55 minutes, and 18 seconds. Today, the record is 30% faster at 2 hours, 2 minutes, and 57 seconds.

In the same year, the double somersault for men's diving was considered to be too dangerous and should be banned. Today, the same move can be done by 10 year olds.

In 1973, the highest digits of pi memorized was 511. In 2015, the world record was 70,000 digits.

While the abilities are extraordinary, the practice of developing them is not. Competition and research creates more *sophisticated training*. People also devoted more time to practice. The result is a steady improvement of performers in various fields. With more data, research indicated that effective practice techniques work in essentially the same way despite different domains.

### Normal Practice

Most people learn a new skill through a similar path. They start off with a general idea of what they want to do, learn from a resource like a book or teacher, practice until an acceptable level, and let it become automatic. Once they reach this satisfactory level, they assume that the skill becomes better through regular use.

Research has shown that once a person achieves an acceptable performance and *automaticity*, additional years of practice don't lead to improvement. People actually get worse over time from lack of efforts to improve.

### Purposeful Practice

Purposeful practice has *clear and specific goals*. It is about putting multiple small steps together to achieve a long-term goal. Figure out the general goal and turn it into something specific that can be worked on with a realistic expectation of improvement.

It is *focused*. There is seldom improvement without giving full attention to the task.

It involves *meaningful feedback*. If the errors are not identified and corrected, the student will not know what to work on. By recoginizing where the weaknesses are, the student can focus appropriately and come up with techniques to address them.

It requires *pushing outside the comfort zone*. This is the most important part. 

#### Comfort Zone

If the student does not push beyond what is familiar and comfortable, there can be no improvement. Doing the same thing over and over again is a recipe for stagnation. Generally, the solution not try harder but rather *try differently*. The same technique that worked before might not work again once the student hits the plateau. A new technique has to be developed to break through the barrier.

Working with a **teacher** is useful. Someone who is already familiar with the obstacles the student is likely to encounter can suggest ways to overcome them.

Sometimes the barrier is more psychological than anything else. Research has shown that a true obstacle with no way around is surprisingly rare. The person often gives up and stop trying rather than hitting an immutable limit on performance.

The caveat is that it is not easy to improve. Maintaining the focus and effort required is hard work and not enjoyable.

### Limits of Purposeful Practice

Steve developed a collection of **mnemonics** based on running times to encode long strings of digits. The digits 907 is conceptualized as 9:07, a good 2-mile run time. That allowed him to use long-term memory to sidestep limitations of the short-term memory. Steve always decided before the training session what pattern he would use to break up and organize the digits into meaningful numbers. These prefixed patterns are referred to as **retrieval structure**.

**Dario Donatelli** was another volunteer who was recruited. Steve taught Dario the technique and Dario was able to designed a different retrieval structure that worked much better for him. Dario eventually reaches over 100 digits.

It is generally possible to improve with focused practice and staying out of comfort zone. But there are other important aspects to practice and training that are often overlooked.
