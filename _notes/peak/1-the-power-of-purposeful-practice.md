## Memorizing Digits

In the 1970s, **Steve Faloon** was an undergraduate who participated in an experiment to memorize numbers. Steve was selected for the experiment because he was an average student at the university. After the first week, Steve was ready to give up because he could not get past 8 digits.

- Before this experiment, decades of research indicated that the brain has a strict limit for short-term memory. It is about 7 items.
- No one has found the upper limits of long-term memory but it takes much longer to recall.

During the experiment, the professor reads 1 digit per second so Steve has to rely on his short-term memory. The process for the session is as followed:

1. Start with 5 digits
2. Right answer increases the string by 1 digit
3. Wrong answer decreases the string by 2 digits

After several training sessions, Steve was suddenly able push past the ceiling and got 11 digits correctly. From that point, Steve was able to improve steadily. After about 100 sessions, he got 40 digits right. By the end of more than 200 sessions, he could recall more than *82 digits*. Steve was not aware that the task was deemed impossible until afterwards.

## Extraordinary Performers

In 1908, the **marathon world record** was 2 hours, 55 minutes, and 18 seconds. Today, the record is 30% faster at 2 hours, 2 minutes, and 57 seconds.

In the same year, the double somersault for men's diving was considered to be too dangerous and should be banned. Today, the same move can be done by 10 year olds.

In 1973, the highest digits of pi memorized was 511. In 2015, the world record was 70,000 digits.

While the abilities are extraordinary, the practice of developing them is not. Competition and research creates more *sophisticated training*. People also devoted more time to practice. The result is a steady improvement of performers in various fields. With more data, research indicated that effective practice techniques work in essentially the same way despite different domains.

### Usual Practice

Most people learn a new skill through a similar path. They start off with a general idea of what they want to do, learn from a resource like a book or teacher, practice until an acceptable level, and let it become automatic. Once they reach this satisfactory level, they assume that the skill becomes better through regular use.

Research has shown that once a person achieves an acceptable performance and *automaticity*, additional years of practice don't lead to improvement. People actually get worse over time from lack of efforts to improve.
