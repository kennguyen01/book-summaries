> With proper training, any child could be turned into a genius. The 4 stages of expertise are: starting interest, getting serious, commitment, and becoming pathfinder. In the first 2 stages, the students need a lot of support and guidance from family and teachers to maintain their motivation. In the third stage, the students have to commit their lives to the pursuit. They have to put in tremendous efforts to reach the frontiers. Eventually some of them might become pathfinders and contribute something unique to their fields.

## Raising Chess Prodigies

In the late 1960s, psychologist **Laszlo Polgar** believed that with proper training, any child could be turned into a genius. He and his wife Klara chose chess because it was an objective game and easy to measure.

Their first daughter Susan became the top-ranked woman player when she was 15 and the first woman to become grandmaster in the same path as male players. The second daughter Sofia won against several grandmasters in Rome when she was 14. The third daughter *Judit became a grandmaster at 15*, the youngest person ever to reach that level.

## Stages of Expertise

The sisters provided a clear example of what it takes to become an expert performers. Psychologists found that their development passes through **four stages of expertise**, from starting interest to full-fledged expertise.

### Starting Out

In the first stage, children are introduced in a playful way to what will eventually become their field of interest. The **desire to play** serves as a child's initial motivation to try out different things.

The *parents play a crucial role* in the child's development. They must give a great deal of time, attention, and encouragement. They tend to be achivement-oriented and teach their children values such as self-discipline, hard work, responsibility, and spending time constructively. An excellent motivator is praise when the child have developed a skill.

Children develop their interests so they can spend more time with their parents. Children who have siblings performing an activity will naturally want to join in and get some attention and praise as well. **Competition between siblings is helpful** for developing initial motivation.

The general pattern is that they became very interested in a particular area and showed more promise than other children of similar age.

### Getting Serious

The second stage is to take lessons from a coach or teacher. These students will **encounter deliberate practice at this point**. Their practice is about to become work.

The instructors do not need to be expert themselves. But they should know how to motivate their students and keep them moving forward. The most improtant factor in the early days is *maintaining interest while the skills and habits are being built*. Parents can provide support and push children to prioritize practice.

**Ultimately motivation must come from within** the students, or else it won't endure. As the students improve, they can seek out better teachers to take them to the next level. After about 2 to 5 years, the students start to identify themselves in term of their skills.

### Commitment

In the third stage, future experts have to **make a major commitment to becoming the best** they can be. They will face expectations to improve as much as humanly possible. The goal is to get out to the edge of human ability.

The training can become incredibly expensive. Very few families can afford to have more than one child pursue this level of performance. But the students who get past this difficult journey will join the elite performers.

#### Benefits of Starting Young

While there are few absolute limits on adults learning new skills, *expertise in some fields* is simply unattainable for anyone who doesn't start training as a child.

Physical performance peaks around age 20. Professional athletes typically maintain their peak performance during their 20s. They can remain competive in their 30s or even early 40s. Older athletes have to be more careful injury and their bodies take longer to recover from training. Adults can acquire new skills but the training changes as they get older. 

### Pathfinders

Many fields have people whose contributions leave their fields forever changed. Familiar names include Beethoven, van Gogh, Newton, and Darwin. This is the fourth stage of expertise, where some people *move beyond the existing knowledge and make unique contributions*.

Innovation is a long, slow, iterative process. The experts might not know where they're going, but they recognize problems that need solutions. **There are no big leaps**, only developments that look like big leaps to people from the outside. Creativity goes together with ability to work hard and maintain focus.

Once the pathfinders show how something can be done, others can learn or figure out. Progress is made by those on the frontiers, not by those who haven't put in the effort needed to reach that frontier.
